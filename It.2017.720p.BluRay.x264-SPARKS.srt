1
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,380
Sure I won't get in trouble, Bill?

2
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,580
Don't be a wuss.

3
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,300
I'd come with you if I weren't
dying.

4
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,900
You're not dying!

5
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,740
You didn't see the vomit
coming out of my nose this morning?

6
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,420
That's disgusting.

7
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,660
Okay. Go get the wax.

8
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,940
In the cellar?

9
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,980
You want it to float, don't you?

10
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,940
Fine.

11
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,710
Georgie.

12
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,300
Hurry up.

13
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,460
Okay. I'm brave.

14
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,500
Where's the wax?

15
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,130
There's the wax.

16
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
Yes.

17
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,770
What was that? What's that?

18
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,470
Oh, jeez.

19
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,820
All right.

20
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,020
There you go.

21
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,180
She's all ready, Captain.

22
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,430
She?

23
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,190
You always call boats "she."

24
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,590
"She."

25
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,090
Thanks, Billy.

26
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,810
See you later. Bye.

27
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,820
Be careful.

28
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,910
No!

29
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,150
No!

30
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,500
Oh, Bill's gonna kill me.

31
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,740
Hiya, Georgie.

32
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,460
What a nice boat.

33
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,590
Do you want it back?

34
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,060
Um, yes, please.

35
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,540
You look like a nice boy.
I bet you have a lot of friends.

36
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,700
Three, but my brother's my best best.

37
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,140
Where is he?

38
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,500
In bed. Sick.

39
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,180
I bet I can cheer him up.
I'll give him a balloon.

40
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,420
Do you want a balloon too, Georgie?

41
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,860
I'm not supposed to take stuff
from strangers.

42
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,580
Oh... Well, I'm Pennywise
the Dancing Clown.

43
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,930
"Pennywise?" "Yes."
"Meet Georgie.

44
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,380
"Georgie, meet Pennywise."

45
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,140
Now we aren't strangers, are we?

46
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,140
What are you doing in the sewer?

47
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,860
A storm blew me away.

48
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,340
Blew the whole circus away.

49
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,550
Can you smell the circus, Georgie?

50
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,780
There's peanuts, cotton candy,

51
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,940
hot dogs,

52
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,820
and...

53
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,790
Popcorn?

54
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,140
Popcorn! Is that your favorite?

55
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,100
- Uh-huh.
- Mine, too.

56
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,060
Because they pop.
Pop, pop, pop.

57
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,630
Pop, pop, pop.

58
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,740
Pop.

59
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,140
I should get going now.

60
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,390
Oh.

61
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,540
Without your boat?

62
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,500
You don't wanna lose it, Georgie.

63
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,860
Bill's gonna kill you.

64
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,900
Here.

65
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,220
Take it.

66
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,980
Take it, Georgie.

67
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,740
Help!

68
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,970
Billy!

69
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,700
Pull it, Mike.

70
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,540
Go on now, pull it.

71
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,660
Here, reload it.

72
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,780
You need to start taking
more responsibility around here, Mike.

73
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,640
Your dad was younger than you
when he took...

74
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm not my dad, okay?

75
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,620
Yeah.

76
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,180
Look at me, son.

77
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,070
Look at me!

78
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,260
There are two places you can be
in this world.

79
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,380
You can be out here like us
or you can be in there,

80
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,340
like them.

81
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,300
You waste time hemming and hawing,

82
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,900
and someone else
is gonna make that choice for you.

83
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,780
Except you won't know it until
you feel that bolt between your eyes.

84
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,400
So, there's this church
full of Jews, right?

85
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,340
And Stan has to take this
super Jewy test.

86
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,980
But how's it work?

87
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,940
They slice the tip of his dick off.

88
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,630
But then Stan will have nothing left!

89
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,340
- That's true.
- Wait up, you guys!

90
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,010
Hey, Stan, what happens
at the Bar Mitzvah, anyways?

91
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,580
Ed says they slice
the tip of your dick off.

92
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,030
Yeah, and I think the rabbi's
gonna pull down your pants,

93
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,030
turn to the crowd and say,
"Where's the beef?"

94
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,450
At the Bar Mitzvah,
I read from the Torah,

95
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,020
and then I make a speech
and suddenly, I become a man.

96
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,960
I could think of funner ways
to become a man.

97
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,150
"More fun" you mean.

98
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,310
Oh, shit.

99
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,580
Think they'll sign my yearbook?

100
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,790
"Dear Richie,

101
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,590
"sorry for taking a hot, steaming dump
in your backpack last March.

102
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,500
"Have a good summer."

103
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,720
Are you in there
by yourself, Beaver-ly?

104
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,260
Or do you have half the guys in the school
with you, huh, slut?

105
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,780
I know you're in there, little shit.
I can smell you.

106
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,820
No wonder you don't have any friends.

107
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,940
Which is it, Gretta?
Am I a slut or a little shit?

108
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,490
Make up your mind.

109
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,860
You're trash.

110
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,670
We just wanted to remind you.

111
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,750
Such a loser.

112
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,580
Well, at least now
you'll smell better.

113
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,790
Gross.

114
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,940
Let's go, girls.

115
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,780
Have a nice summer, Beaver-ly.

116
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,860
Pathetic.

117
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,290
Best feeling ever.

118
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,470
Yeah?

119
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,350
Try tickling your pickle
for the first time.

120
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,880
Hey, what do you guys wanna do tomorrow?

121
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,050
I start my training.

122
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,040
- Wait, what training?
- Street Fighter.

123
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,530
Is that how you wanna spend your summer?
Inside of an arcade?

124
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,670
Beats spending it inside of your mother.

125
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,380
- Oh!
- What if we go to the quarry?

126
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,060
Guys, we have the Barrens.

127
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,300
Right.

128
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,730
Betty Ripsom's mom.

129
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,110
Is she really expecting to
see her come out of that school?

130
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,740
I don't know.

131
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,320
As if Betty Ripsom's been hiding
in Home Ec. for the last few weeks.

132
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,680
You think
they'll actually find her?

133
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,710
Sure.

134
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,340
In a ditch. All decomposed,
covered in worms and maggots.

135
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,720
Smelling like Eddie's mom's underwear.

136
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,190
Shut up! That's freaking disgusting.

137
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,340
She's not dead. She's missing.

138
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,780
Sorry, Bill. She's missing.

139
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,940
You know the Barrens aren't that bad.

140
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,700
Who doesn't love splashing around
in shitty water?

141
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,060
Nice Frisbee, flamer.

142
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,940
Give it back!

143
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,190
Fucking losers!

144
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,470
Loser.

145
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,460
You suck, Bowers.

146
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,930
Shut up, Bill.

147
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,100
You say something, Billy?

148
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,620
You got a free ride this year
'cause of your little brother.

149
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,300
Ride's over, Denbrough.

150
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,630
This summer's gonna be a hurt train
for you and your faggot friends.

151
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,460
I wish he'd go missing.

152
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,180
He's probably the one doing it.

153
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,830
You gonna let me go by?

154
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,820
Or is there a secret password
or something?

155
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,110
Oh.

156
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,380
- Um, sorry.
- Sorry isn't...

157
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,530
A password.

158
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,380
Henry and his goons are over
by the west entrance.

159
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,730
So you should be fine.

160
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,990
Oh, I wasn't...

161
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,020
Everyone knows he's looking for you.

162
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,740
What you listening to?

163
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,180
New Kids on the Block.

164
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,840
I don't even like them. I was just...

165
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,180
Wait. You're the new kid, right?
Now I get it.

166
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,860
There's nothing to get.

167
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,100
I'm just messing with you.

168
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,700
I'm Beverly Marsh.

169
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,260
Yeah. I know that
'cause we're in the same class.

170
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,540
Social Studies. And you were...

171
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,180
I'm Ben. But pretty much
everybody just calls me...

172
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,740
The new kid.

173
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,100
Well, Ben, there are worse things
to be called.

174
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,940
Let me sign this.

175
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,260
Stay cool, Ben from sosh class.

176
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,780
Uh, yeah.

177
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,740
You too, Beverly.

178
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,020
Hang tough, new kid on the block.

179
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,780
"Please Don't Go, Girl."

180
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,020
That's the name of another
New Kids on the Block song.

181
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,780
"He thrusts his fists
against the posts...

182
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,510
"He thrusts his fists against...

183
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,130
Shit!

184
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,150
"Post."

185
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,900
Need some help? I...

186
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,020
I thought we agreed.

187
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,070
- Before you say anything...
- Bill.

188
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,690
Just let me show you something first.

189
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,540
The Barrens.

190
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,060
It's the only place that
Georgie could have ended up.

191
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,700
He's gone, Bill.

192
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,660
But if the storm swept Georgie in,
we should have gone...

193
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,900
He's gone! He's dead!

194
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,700
He's dead! There is nothing we can do!
Nothing!

195
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,460
Now take this down
before your mother sees it.

196
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,010
Next time you wanna take something
from my office...

197
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,220
Ask.

198
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,540
I guess you get your tunnels back.

199
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,710
Get in!

200
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,910
Creep!

201
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,210
Oh, Jesus.

202
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,270
Mike!

203
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,190
Hurry, son!

204
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,020
Help! It burns!

205
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,790
Mike!

206
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,500
Stay the fuck outta my town!

207
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,830
Mike?

208
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,490
Are you okay?

209
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,540
You're not studying, Stanley.

210
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,340
How's it going to look?

211
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,700
The rabbi's son
can't finish his own Torah reading.

212
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,180
Take the book to my office.

213
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,300
Obviously you're not using it.

214
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,960
Take everything
but the Delicious Deals, guys.

215
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,050
My mom loves them.

216
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,980
Hey! First you said the Barrens,
and now you're saying the sewer.

217
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,650
I mean, what if we get caught?

218
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,470
We won't, Eds.
The sewers are public works.

219
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,940
We're the public, aren't we?

220
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,820
Hey, Eddie,
these your birth control pills?

221
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,580
Yeah, and I'm saving it for your sister.
This is private stuff.

222
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,450
Hello, and welcome to
the Derry Children's Hour.

223
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,770
Eddie Bear, where you boys off to
in such a rush?

224
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,460
Um...

225
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,980
Just my backyard, Mrs. K.

226
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,100
I got a new...

227
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,380
- A new croquet set.
- Jeez, spit it out, Bill!

228
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,620
Okay.

229
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,690
Oh, and sweetie, don't go
rolling around on the grass.

230
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,620
Especially if it's just been cut.

231
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,260
You know how bad your allergies can get.

232
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,820
Yes, Mom. Let's go.

233
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,360
Aren't you forgetting something?

234
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,420
Water is all around us.
It's even above us.

235
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,250
Don't believe me?

236
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,900
Then try it yourself at home.

237
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,150
Whenever you're outside...

238
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,520
Do you want one from me too, Mrs. K?

239
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,990
- I was kidding.
- No, no, no.

240
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,770
Sorry, Mommy.

241
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,500
"Your hair is winter fire,
January embers...

242
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,460
"My heart burns there too."

243
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,670
Slow down!

244
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,620
Hi-ho, Silver!

245
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,870
Away!

246
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,260
Your old lady bike's
too fast for us!

247
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,220
Found it.

248
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,100
Isn't it summer vacation?

249
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,140
I would think you'd be ready
to take a break from the books.

250
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,410
I like it in here.

251
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,340
A boy should be spending his summer
outside with friends.

252
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,900
Don't you have any friends?

253
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,500
Can I have the book now?

254
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,210
Egg boy.

255
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,590
What on earth are you doing?

256
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,460
Where are you off to, tits?

257
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,390
Gotcha.

258
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,620
Wait.

259
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,160
- Fucking hold him.
- Leave me alone!

260
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,320
- Smack him.
- Don't let tubby get away.

261
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,350
Help!

262
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,020
Get him!

263
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,180
- Hold him, Hockstetter.
- Get him, Belch.

264
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,310
Stop!

265
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,150
- Just leave me alone.
- Look at all this blubber!

266
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,300
Let me light his hair,
like Michael Jackson.

267
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,950
Just hold him.

268
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,220
Get off me! Get off me!

269
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,710
Help!

270
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,970
Help!

271
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,850
Okay, new kid.

272
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,270
This is what us locals
call the Kissing Bridge.

273
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,230
It's famous for two things.
Sucking face,

274
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,100
and carving names.

275
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,620
Henry, please.

276
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,310
Whoa, whoa! Henry!

277
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,530
Shut up!

278
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,870
I'm gonna carve my whole name
onto this cottage cheese!

279
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm gonna cut your fucking tits off.
I swear to God!

280
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,210
Get him!

281
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,430
Come on!

282
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,250
Get him!

283
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,710
You can't run!

284
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,860
- Oh, no!
- We need to find Fatty!

285
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,580
My knife. My old man will kill me!

286
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,860
- You two, get him!
- Come on!

287
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,700
Move your fucking ass!

288
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,570
He's going that way! Come on!

289
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,260
He's down there.

290
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,420
I don't know. I guess.

291
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,380
That's poison ivy.
And that's poison ivy.

292
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,820
And that's poison ivy.

293
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,700
Where? Where's the poison ivy?

294
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,780
Nowhere. Not every fucking plant
is poison ivy, Stanley.

295
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,060
Okay, I'm starting to get itchy now

296
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,600
and I'm pretty sure
this is not good for my...

297
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,220
Do you use the same bathroom
as your mother?

298
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,460
Sometimes, yeah.

299
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,150
Then you probably have crabs.

300
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,430
That's so not funny.

301
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,700
Aren't you guys coming in?

302
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,260
Uh-uh. It's greywater.

303
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,610
What the hell's greywater?

304
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,620
It's basically piss and shit.
So I'm just telling you,

305
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,300
you guys are splashing around
in millions of gallons of Derry pee. So...

306
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,760
Are you serious? What are you...

307
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,920
Doesn't smell like caca to me, señor.

308
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,740
Okay, I can smell that from here.

309
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,270
It's probably just your breath
wafting back into your face.

310
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,700
Have you ever heard
of a staph infection?

311
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,240
Oh, I'll show you a staff infection.

312
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,960
This is so unsanitary.
You're literally...

313
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,280
This is literally like swimming
inside of a toilet bowl right now.

314
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,700
Have you ever heard of Listeria?

315
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,630
Are you retarded?

316
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,680
You're the reason why
we're in this position right now.

317
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,930
Guys!

318
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,260
Shit. Don't tell me that's...

319
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,870
No.

320
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,460
Georgie wore galoshes.

321
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,370
Whose sneaker is it?

322
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,450
It's Betty Ripsom's.

323
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,090
Oh, shit.

324
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,580
Oh, God. Oh, fuck!

325
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,860
I don't like this.

326
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,860
How do you think Betty feels?

327
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,220
Running around these tunnels
with only one frickin' shoe?

328
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,860
What if she's still here?

329
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,370
Eddie, come on!

330
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,400
My mom will have an aneurysm, if she
finds out that we're playing down here.

331
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,430
I'm serious.

332
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,140
Bill?

333
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,340
If... If I was Betty Ripsom,
I would want us to find me.

334
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,420
Georgie too.

335
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,550
What if I don't want to find them?

336
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,060
I mean, no offense, Bill,
but I don't want to end up like...

337
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,630
I don't want to go missing either.

338
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,540
- He has a point.
- You too?

339
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,100
It's summer.

340
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,740
We're supposed to be having fun.

341
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,340
This isn't fun.

342
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,330
This is scary and disgusting.

343
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,100
Holy shit! What happened to you?

344
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,060
I hear ya, tits.

345
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,900
Don't think you can stay down here
all damn day now.

346
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,650
You found us, Patrick.

347
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,780
You found us, Patrick.

348
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,300
Patrick.

349
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,710
Fuck!

350
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,000
I think it's great that
we're helping the new kid,

351
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,560
but also we need to think
of our own safety.

352
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,320
I mean, he's bleeding all over
and you guys know

353
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,640
that there's an AIDS epidemic happening
right now as we speak, right?

354
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,140
My mom's friend in New York City got it
by touching a dirty pole on the subway.

355
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,350
And a drop of AIDS blood got into
his system through a hangnail. A hangnail!

356
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,380
And you can amputate legs and arms.

357
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,100
But how do you amputate a waist?

358
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,800
You guys do know that alleys are known
for dirty needles that have AIDS, right?

359
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,830
You guys do know that?

360
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,660
- Hey...
- Ah, we're screwed.

361
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,580
Richie, wait here. Come on.

362
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,100
Glad I got to meet you
before you died.

363
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,450
Okay.

364
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,530
Can we afford all that?

365
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,830
It's all we got.

366
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,140
You kidding me?

367
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,820
Wait, you have an account here,
don't you?

368
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,980
If my mom finds out
I bought all this stuff for myself...

369
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,350
I'm spending the whole rest of the weekend
in the emergency room getting X-rayed.

370
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,110
See you later, Dad.

371
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,180
See you, Gretta.

372
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,100
You okay?

373
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,860
I'm fine. What's wrong with you?

374
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,340
None of your business.

375
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,740
There's a kid outside.
Looked like someone killed him.

376
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,980
We need some supplies,

377
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,860
but we don't have enough money.

378
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,900
I like your glasses, Mr. Keene.

379
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,820
You look just like Clark Kent.

380
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,340
Oh.

381
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,020
I don't know about that.

382
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,490
Can I try them?

383
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,340
Mmm. Sure.

384
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,060
What do you think?

385
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,260
Well, how about that?

386
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,940
You look just like Lois Lane.

387
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,060
Really?

388
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,660
Mmm.

389
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,340
Well, here you go.

390
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,180
Shoot, I'm so sorry.

391
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,930
It's okay.

392
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,310
Just suck the wound.

393
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,520
- I need to focus right now.
- You need to focus?

394
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,880
Yeah, can you go get me something?

395
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,900
- Jesus! What do you need?
- Go get my bifocals.

396
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,400
I hid 'em in my second fanny pack.

397
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,000
Why do you have two fanny packs?

398
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,720
I need to focus right now
and it's a long story.

399
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,870
I don't want to get into it.

400
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,220
Um, thanks.

401
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,460
Even-steven.

402
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,970
Oh, God, he's bleeding.
Oh, my God!

403
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,270
Ben from sosh?

404
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,960
You have to suck the wound
before you apply the Band-Aids.

405
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,960
- This is 101.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

406
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,940
Are you okay?
That looks like it hurts.

407
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,140
Oh. No, I'm good. I just fell.

408
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,660
Yeah, right into Henry Bowers.

409
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,340
Shut it, Richie.

410
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,730
Why? It's the truth.

411
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,820
You sure they got the right stuff
to fix you up?

412
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,830
You know, we'll take care of him.

413
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,300
Uh, thanks again, Beverly.

414
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,500
Sure. Maybe I'll see you around.

415
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,700
Yeah, we were thinking about

416
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,460
going to the quarry tomorrow,

417
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,380
if you wanna

418
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,790
come.

419
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,700
Good to know. Thanks.

420
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,430
Nice going bringing up Bowers
in front of her.

421
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,030
Yeah, dude, you heard what she did.

422
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,900
What'd she do?

423
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,180
More like "Who'd she do?"

424
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,500
From what I hear,
the list is longer than my wang.

425
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,340
That's not saying much.

426
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,020
They're just rumors.

427
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,420
Anyway, Bill had her
back in third grade.

428
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,910
They kissed in the school play.

429
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,410
The reviews said you can't fake
that sort of passion.

430
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,150
Now, pip-pip
and tally-ho, my good fellows,

431
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,680
I do believe this chap requires
our utmost attention.

432
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,310
Get in there, Dr. K.
Come on, fix him up.

433
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,520
Why don't you shut the fuck up,
Einstein, because I know what I'm doing

434
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,160
and I don't want you doing
the British guy with me right now.

435
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,960
Suck the wound. Get in there.

436
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,950
Toilet and bath water travel down

437
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,180
the drains and into the sewer.

438
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,940
The sewer is a fun place to play
with all of your friends.

439
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,620
Just follow the water into the drains
and down into the sewers you go.

440
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,380
When you're with your friends in the
sewers, you can be as silly as a clown!

441
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,780
That's right, it's the word of the day.

442
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,150
Hi, Daddy.

443
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,700
Hey, Bevvie.

444
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,500
Whatcha got there?

445
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,220
Just some things.

446
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,970
Like what?

447
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,020
Tell me you're still my little girl.

448
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,900
Yes, Daddy.

449
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,940
Good.

450
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,790
A deep fly ball
to the left. His last at bat.

451
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,580
He scratched the foul pole.

452
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,420
Wade Boggs, of course,
leads the league in hitting so far.

453
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,700
This is what you did.
This is what you...

454
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,180
This is...

455
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,670
Lay it out.

456
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,790
Oh, my God.

457
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,980
- So easy.
- Poor tree.

458
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,540
So easy!

459
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,980
Oh, my God, that was terrible.
I win.

460
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,290
- You won?
- Yeah.

461
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,500
- Did you see my loogie?
- That went the farthest!

462
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,400
- It's by distance.
- Mass. It's always been mass.

463
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,700
What is mass?

464
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,170
Who cares how far it goes?

465
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,430
It matters how cool it looks, like it's
green or it's white or juicy and fat.

466
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,640
- All right.
- Thanks for that.

467
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,030
- Who's first?
- That was terrible.

468
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,420
I'll go!

469
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,830
Sissies.

470
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,100
What the fuck!

471
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,860
Oh, holy shit! We just got showed up
by a girl.

472
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,210
Do we have to do that now?

473
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,430
Yes.

474
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,750
Come on!

475
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,100
Oh, shit.

476
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,980
I already won! We already won!

477
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,860
They're down! Yes!

478
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,860
Ah, fuck! What was that?

479
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,070
Something just touched my foot
right here.

480
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,220
That work?

481
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,160
- Where are we looking?
- Right here, right here!

482
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,190
It's a turtle.

483
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,580
News flash, Ben. School's out for summa!

484
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,300
Oh, that? That's not school stuff.

485
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,390
- Who sent you this?
- No one. Give it...

486
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,530
No one.

487
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,070
- What's with the history project?
- Oh...

488
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,100
When I first moved here,
I didn't have anyone to hang out with,

489
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,900
so I just started spending time
in the library.

490
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,100
You went to the library?

491
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,330
On purpose?

492
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,940
Oh, I wanna see.

493
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,340
What's The Black Spot?

494
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,880
The Black Spot was a nightclub

495
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,800
that was burned down years ago
by that racist cult.

496
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,100
The what?

497
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,510
Don't you watch Geraldo?

498
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,460
Your hair...

499
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,660
Your... Your hair
is beautiful, Beverly.

500
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,900
Oh.

501
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,660
Right. Thanks.

502
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,020
Here, pass it.

503
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,190
Why is it all murders and missing kids?

504
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,140
Derry's not like any town
I've ever been in before.

505
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,980
They did a study once,
and it turns out

506
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,180
people die or disappear
six times the national average.

507
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,620
You read that?

508
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,020
And that's just grown-ups.

509
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,860
Kids are worse.

510
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,530
Way, way worse.

511
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,100
I've got more stuff if you wanna see it.

512
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,420
No, no.

513
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,260
Don't freak out, just tell us.

514
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,790
Yeah. I heard he has
a rollercoaster and a pet chimp

515
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:56,700
and an old guy's fucking bones.
Yeah.

516
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

517
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:00,830
Wow.

518
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,110
Cool, huh?

519
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,940
No. No, nothing cool.

520
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,060
There's nothing cool.

521
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,540
This is cool, right here.
Wait, no. No, it's not cool.

522
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,060
What's that?

523
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,060
Oh, that? That's the charter
for Derry Township.

524
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,780
Nerd alert.

525
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,290
No, actually, it's really interesting.

526
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,260
Derry started as a beaver trapping camp.

527
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,620
Still is, am I right, boys?

528
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:27,460
Ninety-one people signed the charter
that made Derry.

529
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,460
But later that winter,
they all disappeared without a trace.

530
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:32,980
The entire camp?

531
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,820
There were rumors of Indians,

532
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,300
but no sign of an attack.

533
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,140
Everybody just thought
it was a plague or something.

534
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,620
But it's like

535
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:46,300
one day everybody just woke up and left.

536
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,580
The only clue was a trail of
bloody clothes leading to the well house.

537
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,950
Jesus. We can get Derry
on Unsolved Mysteries.

538
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,310
- Let's do that. You're brilliant.
- I might be.

539
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:05,990
I don't know.

540
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,570
Maybe he's just trying to
make some friends, Stanley.

541
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,740
Where was the well house?

542
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,980
I don't know.
Somewhere in town, I guess.

543
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,420
Why?

544
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,810
Nothing.

545
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,170
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen

546
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,020
Nobody knows my sorrow

547
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,660
Eddie...

548
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,510
What are you looking for?

549
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,860
Oh!

550
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,620
Fuck.
My mom's gonna fucking flip.

551
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,210
Do you think this will help me, Eddie?

552
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,790
Help! Help!

553
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,900
Where you going, Eds?

554
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,260
If you lived here, you'd be home by now.

555
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,740
Come join the clown, Eds.

556
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:33,820
You'll float down here.

557
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,140
We all float down here.

558
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,620
Yes, we do.

559
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,620
"Your hair is winter fire...

560
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,730
"January embers...

561
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,970
"My heart burns there, too."

562
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,010
Beverly...

563
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,100
Beverly.

564
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,980
Help me.

565
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,500
Help me, please.

566
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:18,780
We all want to meet you, Beverly.

567
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,340
We all float down here.

568
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,260
Hello? Who are you?

569
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,500
- I'm Veronica.
- Betty Ripsom.

570
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,340
Patrick Hockstetter.

571
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:35,980
Come closer.

572
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,300
- Wanna see?
- We float.

573
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,420
We change.

574
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,790
Daddy!

575
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,060
Help!

576
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,660
Help!

577
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:31,850
The hell's going on?

578
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,580
The sink...

579
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,700
And the blood... It's...

580
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,740
What blood?

581
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,540
The sink. You don't see it?

582
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,100
There was blood.

583
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,580
You worry me, Bevvie.

584
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,900
You worry me a lot.

585
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,900
But don't you see?

586
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,340
Why'd you do this to your hair?

587
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,740
Makes you look like a boy.

588
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,300
Georgie.

589
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,100
I lost it, Billy.
Don't be mad.

590
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,290
I'm not mad at you.

591
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,060
It just floated off.

592
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:53,450
But, Bill, if you'll come with me,

593
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,780
you'll float, too.

594
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,130
Georgie.

595
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,230
You'll float, too.
You'll float, too.

596
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:02,260
You'll float, too.

597
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,400
- You'll float, too.
- You'll float, too.

598
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:07,420
You'll float, too. You'll float, too.

599
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,940
You'll float, too.

600
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:12,740
You'll float, too!
You'll float, too!

601
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,900
You'll float, too!

602
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,420
You'll float, too!

603
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,480
No, we gotta go
through the alleyway.

604
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,760
The alley takes way too long.

605
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,320
No, the alley is so much faster.

606
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:39,840
The alley is more dangerous
and it's disgusting.

607
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,120
How is it more dangerous?

608
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,680
It smells like piss and it's gross.

609
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,600
- Just take the side streets for once.
- Oh, my God.

610
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,190
The side streets are the same.
They smell like piss and shit.

611
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,640
Okay, okay. Can you just tell me
what she said exactly?

612
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,800
She didn't say anything.

613
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,000
She just said that
you guys need to hurry over.

614
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,710
She didn't say
anything. Okay. Okay.

615
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,100
You made it. I...

616
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:57,860
I need to show you something.

617
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:59,170
What is it?

618
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,680
More than we saw at the quarry?

619
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:02,020
Shut up! Just shut up, Richie.

620
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:06,220
My dad will kill me if he finds out
I had boys in the apartment.

621
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,860
Then we'll leave a lookout.

622
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,220
Richie, stay here.

623
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What if her dad comes back?

624
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:16,850
Do what you always do. Start talking.

625
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,130
It is a gift.

626
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,310
In there.

627
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,220
What is it?

628
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:34,700
You'll see.

629
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,580
Are you taking us
to your bathroom?

630
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,200
I just want you to know that 89%
of the worst accidents in homes

631
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,060
are caused in bathrooms.

632
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,020
And, I mean, that's where
all the bacteria and fungi are

633
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,420
and it's not a really sanitary place...

634
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,260
I knew it!

635
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:52,430
You see it?

636
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,180
- Yes.
- What...

637
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:55,730
What happened in here?

638
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:59,570
My dad couldn't see it.
I thought I might be crazy.

639
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,940
Well, if you're crazy,
then we're all crazy.

640
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,260
We can't leave it like this.

641
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,320
All right, so you've

642
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:23,640
never been
to the Derry Summer Fair?

643
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,860
No, I don't think so.

644
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,260
Not that I know of.

645
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,180
Well, I go there every year,

646
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,550
but I was there one time with Richie and
technically won 'cause I hit the target.

647
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,330
But there were so many prizes,
I didn't know which to pick.

648
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,020
It's not true, you know.

649
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,620
What they say about me.

650
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,540
I was only ever kissed by one guy.

651
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,340
It was a long time ago.

652
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,340
It was a nice kiss though.

653
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,900
"January embers."

654
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,540
Was that in the play?

655
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,300
No, the poem.

656
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:17,860
Oh...

657
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,220
Oh,
I don't really know much poetry.

658
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,500
Oh. I was just...

659
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:29,660
Never mind then.

660
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,890
Um...

661
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,580
Just so you know, I...

662
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,820
I never believed any of the rumors.

663
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:45,100
And none of us Losers do.

664
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:48,900
We like hanging with you.

665
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,780
Thanks.

666
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,940
You shouldn't thank us too much.

667
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:57,180
Hanging out with us
makes you a Loser, too.

668
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,260
I can take that.

669
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:07,080
No, I love being
your personal doorman, really.

670
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,740
Could you idiots have taken any longer?

671
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,920
- All right, shut up, Richie.
- Yeah, shut up, Richie.

672
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,380
Oh, okay, trash the trashmouth,
I get it.

673
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,550
Hey, I wasn't the one
scrubbing the bathroom floor

674
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,940
and imagining that her sink went all
Eddie's mom's vagina on Halloween.

675
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,140
She didn't imagine it.

676
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,610
I...

677
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,220
I saw something, too.

678
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:30,430
You saw blood, too?

679
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,450
Not blood.

680
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:39,300
I saw Georgie.

681
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,820
It seemed so real.

682
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:45,060
I mean, it seemed like him,
but there was this...

683
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,990
The clown.

684
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,420
Yeah, I saw him, too.

685
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:03,020
Wait, can only virgins see this stuff?

686
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,740
Is that why I'm not seeing this shit?

687
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,670
Oh, shit,
that's Belch Huggins' car.

688
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,120
- We should probably get outta here.
- Yeah.

689
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,500
Wait, isn't that
the homeschooled kid's bike?

690
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:15,870
Yeah, that's Mike's.

691
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,340
We have to help him.

692
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,780
We should?

693
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:21,990
Yes.

694
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:30,700
Come on.

695
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:33,190
Eat that meat!

696
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,860
- Eat it, bitch!
- You little fucker!

697
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,660
- Bitch!
- Motherfucker!

698
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,710
- Eat it, you little bitch!
- Pussy!

699
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:40,390
Fucking...

700
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,700
Whatcha gonna do, huh?

701
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:42,870
Get up!

702
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,290
Get the fuck up!

703
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,690
You little fucker!

704
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,810
Come on, Henry, smack him!

705
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,430
You little bitch.

706
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:06,380
- Nice throw.
- Thanks.

707
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,030
You losers
are trying too hard.

708
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:15,860
She'll do you.

709
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,860
You just gotta ask nicely,

710
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:20,580
like I did.

711
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,020
What the fuck?

712
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,070
Come on, get 'em! Fuck!

713
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,500
Rock war!

714
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,380
- Get 'em!
- Watch out!

715
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,700
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

716
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,370
Eddie!

717
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,870
- Fuck outta here!
- Ow!

718
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,410
Ah, shit!

719
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,180
Fuck you, bitch!

720
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,520
Come on, guys!
Let's get 'em!

721
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,000
- Fuck this.
- Fuck out of here.

722
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,620
Fuck you, losers!

723
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:26,260
Go blow your dad,
you mullet-wearing asshole!

724
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:37,310
Thanks, guys,
but you shouldn't have done that.

725
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,940
They'll be after you guys, too, now.

726
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:42,660
Oh, no, no, no. Bowers?
He's always after us.

727
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:47,180
I guess that's one thing
we all have in common.

728
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:50,780
Yeah, Homeschool.
Welcome to the Losers' Club.

729
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:55,910
Right there.

730
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,000
They say they found
part of his hand

731
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,350
all chewed up near the Standpipe.

732
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,580
He asked to borrow a pencil once.

733
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,170
It's like she's been forgotten

734
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:15,580
because Corcoran's missing.

735
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,390
Is it ever gonna end?

736
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:19,780
What the fuck, dude?

737
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:21,580
What are you guys talking about?

738
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,820
What they always talk about.

739
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:25,460
I actually think it will end.

740
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,180
For a little while, at least.

741
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,390
What do you mean?

742
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,380
So I was going over
all my Derry research

743
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:33,180
and I charted out all the big events.

744
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,420
The Ironworks explosion in 1908,

745
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,340
the Bradley Gang in '35,

746
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,580
and The Black Spot in '62.

747
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,740
And now kids being...

748
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,330
I realized this stuff seems to happen...

749
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,140
Every 27 years.

750
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,840
Okay, so, let me get this straight.

751
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,110
It comes out from wherever
to eat kids for, like, a year?

752
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,180
And then what?
It just goes into hibernation?

753
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:01,860
Maybe it's like...
What do you call it?

754
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,260
Cicadas.

755
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,590
You know, the bugs that come out
once every 17 years.

756
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,460
My grandfather thinks
this town is cursed.

757
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,470
He says that

758
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:12,580
all the bad things
that happen in this town

759
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,420
are because of one thing.

760
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:17,340
An evil thing that feeds off
the people of Derry.

761
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,740
But it can't be one thing.

762
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:22,420
We all saw something different.

763
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:24,110
Maybe.

764
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,710
Or maybe It knows what scares us most
and that's what we see.

765
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,940
I saw a leper.

766
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,180
He was like a walking infection.

767
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,010
But you didn't.

768
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,380
Because it isn't real.

769
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,100
None of this is.

770
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,090
Not Eddie's leper

771
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,460
or Bill seeing Georgie

772
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:46,220
or the woman I keep seeing.

773
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,390
She hot?

774
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,210
No, Richie.

775
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:51,950
She's not hot.

776
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:55,140
Her face is all messed up.

777
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:59,060
None of this makes any sense.

778
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,300
They're all like bad dreams.

779
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:06,140
I don't think so. I know the difference
between a bad dream and real life, okay?

780
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,300
What'd you see?
You saw something, too?

781
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:10,510
Yes.

782
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:14,870
Do you guys know that burned-down house
on Harris Avenue?

783
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,740
I was inside when it burned down.

784
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:23,030
Before I was rescued,

785
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:26,660
my mom and dad were trapped
in the next room over from me.

786
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:31,500
They were pushing
and pounding on the door,

787
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,260
trying to get to me.

788
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:36,510
Hurry, son!

789
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:37,940
It burns!

790
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:40,220
But it was too hot.

791
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,940
When the firemen finally found them,

792
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:51,860
the skin on their hands had
melted down to the bone.

793
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,260
We're all afraid of something.

794
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,150
Got that right.

795
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:00,700
Why, Rich?
What are you afraid of?

796
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,580
Clowns.

797
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:34,900
Okay.

798
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:37,260
Look.

799
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,060
That's where Georgie disappeared.

800
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,060
There's the Ironworks.

801
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,820
And The Black Spot.

802
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:50,060
Everywhere it happens,
it's all connected by the sewers.

803
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,910
And they all meet up at the...

804
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,140
The well house.

805
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,790
It's in the house on Neibolt Street.

806
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:03,580
You mean that creepy-ass house where
all the junkies and hobos like to sleep?

807
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:06,140
I hate that place.

808
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,820
It always feels like it's watching me.

809
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:10,590
That's where I saw It.

810
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:12,900
That's where I saw the clown.

811
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:17,300
That's where It lives.

812
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,710
I can't imagine anything
ever wanting to live there.

813
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:23,240
Can we stop talking about this?

814
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,140
I can barely breathe.

815
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:26,570
This is summer.

816
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,420
We're kids. I can barely breathe.

817
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:30,310
I'm up here having
a fucking asthma attack.

818
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,780
I'm not doing this.

819
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:33,980
What the hell? Put the map back.

820
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,550
Mmm-mmm.

821
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:43,780
What happened?

822
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:45,460
What's going on?

823
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:47,500
I got it. Hold on.

824
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,340
Guys.

825
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:57,930
Georgie.

826
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,340
Bill?

827
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:18,540
What the fuck?

828
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,490
It's It!

829
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:24,820
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?

830
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,340
I don't fucking know!

831
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,660
Turn it off! Turn it off!

832
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:34,700
Yeah. Yeah,
turn it off. Turn it off!

833
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:55,190
Run, Stanley!

834
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,540
What is it?

835
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:59,860
What the fuck?

836
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,050
Thanks, Ben.

837
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:19,540
It saw us.

838
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,230
It saw us, and it knows where we are.

839
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:23,870
It always did.

840
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:25,940
So, let's go.

841
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,780
Go?

842
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:29,470
Go where?

843
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,740
Neibolt.

844
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:34,380
That's where Georgie is.

845
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,900
After that?

846
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,890
Yeah, it's summer.
We should be outside.

847
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:41,940
If you say it's summer
one more fucking time...

848
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:48,670
Bill!

849
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:50,940
Wait!

850
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,690
"He thrusts his fists

851
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,860
"against the posts

852
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:30,260
"and still insists he sees..."

853
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:32,540
Bill!

854
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:35,340
Bill, you can't go in there.

855
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:36,540
This is crazy.

856
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:38,540
Look, you don't have to come in with me.

857
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:42,820
But what happens when
another Georgie goes missing?

858
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:48,060
Or another Betty?
Or another Ed Corcoran? Or one of us?

859
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:52,140
Are you just gonna pretend it isn't
happening like everyone else in this town?

860
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:55,100
Because I can't.

861
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:01,980
I go home, and all I see is
that Georgie isn't there.

862
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:06,980
His clothes, his toys,
his stupid stuffed animals, but...

863
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,180
He isn't.

864
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,740
So walking into this house,

865
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,420
for me,

866
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,140
it's easier
than walking into my own.

867
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,510
Wow.

868
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:26,770
What?

869
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,460
He didn't stutter once.

870
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,660
Wait!

871
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:36,220
Um...

872
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,820
Shouldn't we have some people
keep watch?

873
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,700
You know, just in case
something bad happens?

874
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,340
Who wants to stay out here?

875
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:58,670
Fuck.

876
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,540
I can't believe
I pulled the short straw.

877
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,510
You guys are lucky
you're not measuring dicks.

878
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,020
Shut up, Richie.

879
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,060
I can smell it.

880
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,310
Don't breathe through your mouth.

881
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:22,390
How come?

882
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,500
Because then you're eating it.

883
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,270
What?

884
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,740
It... It says I'm missing.

885
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:58,030
You're not missing, Richie.

886
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:59,680
"Police department,
City of Derry."

887
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,220
That's my shirt. That's my hair.
That's my face.

888
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,550
Calm down, this isn't real.

889
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,080
That's my name. That's my age!
That's the date!

890
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,110
It can't be real, Richie.

891
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,780
No, it says it! What the fuck?

892
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,460
- Am I missing? Am I gonna go missing?
- Calm down. Calm down.

893
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,540
Look at me, Richie. Look at me.

894
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,460
That... That isn't real.

895
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,620
It's playing tricks on you.

896
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:19,770
Hello?

897
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:24,580
Hello?

898
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,660
Help me, please!

899
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:08,190
Betty?

900
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:09,790
Ripsom?

901
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,500
Eddie...

902
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:26,540
What are you looking for?

903
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:30,380
Guys, can you hear that?

904
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,820
She was just here.
Where the fuck did she go?

905
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,370
Guys.

906
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,660
Oh, my God.

907
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:06,220
Guys. Guys!

908
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:09,890
- Guys! Guys!
- What? Eddie?

909
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,300
What the fuck?

910
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:25,380
Time to take
your pill, Eddie.

911
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:41,460
- Eddie. Open the door!
- Richie.

912
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,500
You okay?

913
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:45,760
Eddie, what's going on?

914
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:46,790
Eds.

915
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:48,630
Eddie.

916
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:50,390
Come here, Richie.

917
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,820
Eddie.

918
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,460
Eddie.

919
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,180
Eddie.

920
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:04,180
Where the fuck are you?

921
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:07,340
We're not playing hide-and-seek, dipshit.

922
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:11,980
Richie?

923
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:16,300
Richie! Richie!

924
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,630
Bill, come on, open the door.

925
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:18,770
It won't open!

926
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,460
- What's going on? Richie!
- I can't!

927
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,430
Open the door, Rich.

928
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:28,830
Oh, shit.

929
01:21:58,510 --> 01:21:59,860
Stupid clowns.

930
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:08,890
Oh, fuck.

931
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,350
Ugh!

932
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:50,420
Beep-beep, Richie.

933
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:56,970
Let's get outta here.

934
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,380
You wanna play loogie?

935
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,570
Time to float.

936
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,470
Where's my shoe?

937
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:41,550
Where the fuck were her legs?

938
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:44,340
Holy shit, what the fuck was that?

939
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:45,510
This isn't real.

940
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:46,990
Remember the missing kid poster.

941
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:48,740
That wasn't real, so this isn't real.

942
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,540
Tasty, tasty, beautiful fear.

943
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:57,910
Come on. Ready?

944
01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:59,100
No!

945
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:02,550
No.

946
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,410
No, no!

947
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,810
Oh, thank fuck.

948
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:11,550
- Where's Eddie?
- Help!

949
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,060
Help!

950
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:16,390
Eddie!

951
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:19,940
Holy fuck.

952
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:21,190
Eddie!

953
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,730
This isn't real enough for you, Billy?

954
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,740
I'm not real enough for you?

955
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,420
Oh, shit.

956
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:33,060
It was real enough for Georgie.

957
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:37,670
Holy shit!

958
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:46,900
- Get Eddie!
- Get Eddie!

959
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:52,690
Oh, fuck! We gotta get out of here!

960
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:00,610
Get Eddie. Let's go!

961
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:01,910
Guys, watch out!

962
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,980
- No, no, no, no!
- Eddie, look at me!

963
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,060
He's gonna get us!
Guys!

964
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:07,580
No!

965
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,620
Ben!

966
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:15,830
Ben!

967
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:23,550
Let's get out of here!

968
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:25,940
Don't let him get away!

969
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:37,910
Bill,
we have to help Eddie!

970
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:39,620
No! No!

971
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:42,120
I'm gonna snap your arm
into place.

972
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:43,350
Rich, do not fucking touch me.

973
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:46,820
- Okay, one, two, three.
- Do not touch me!

974
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,140
Holy shit!

975
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:54,660
You. You did this.

976
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,740
You know how delicate he is.

977
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:59,900
- We were attacked, Mrs. K.
- No. Don't.

978
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:02,660
Don't try and blame anyone else.

979
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,540
- Let me help.
- Get back!

980
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,820
Oh, I've heard of you, Miss Marsh.

981
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:14,060
And I don't want a dirty girl like you
touching my son.

982
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,940
Mrs. K, I...

983
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:21,180
No! You are all monsters.
All of you.

984
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:25,340
And Eddie is done with you.
Do you hear? Done!

985
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:51,310
I saw the well.

986
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:53,460
We know where it is

987
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:56,300
and next time we'll be better prepared.

988
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:57,550
No!

989
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,530
No next time, Bill.

990
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:02,700
- You're insane.
- Why?

991
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,420
We all know no one else
is going to do anything.

992
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,900
Eddie was nearly killed!
And look at this motherfucker.

993
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,940
He's leaking Hamburger Helper!

994
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:11,360
We can't pretend
it's gonna go away.

995
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:14,140
Ben, you said it yourself,
It comes back every 27 years.

996
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:17,220
Fine! I'll be 40 and far away from here.

997
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:20,360
I thought you said you wanted to
get out of this town, too.

998
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:23,220
Because I wanna run towards something.
Not away.

999
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,990
I'm sorry, who invited Molly Ringwald
into the group?

1000
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:29,180
- Richie...
- I'm just saying, let's face facts.

1001
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,430
Real world.

1002
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:33,260
Georgie is dead.
Stop trying to get us killed, too.

1003
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:34,470
Georgie's not dead.

1004
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:38,250
You couldn't save him,
but you can still save yourself.

1005
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:41,260
No, take it back.

1006
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:46,260
You're scared and we all are,
but take it back!

1007
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:49,910
Bill!

1008
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:53,540
You're just a bunch of losers!

1009
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:55,120
- Fuck off!
- Richie, stop.

1010
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:57,240
You're just a bunch of losers
and you'll get yourselves killed

1011
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:59,380
- trying to catch a fucking stupid clown.
- Stop!

1012
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:04,140
This is what It wants.

1013
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:05,650
It wants to divide us.

1014
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:11,090
We were all together when we hurt It.

1015
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:13,300
That's why we're still alive.

1016
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:16,140
Yeah? Well, I plan to keep it that way.

1017
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:29,980
- Mike...
- Guys...

1018
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:33,260
I can't do this.

1019
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,500
My granddad was right.

1020
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:39,660
I'm an outsider.
Gotta stay that way.

1021
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,980
- Yeah! Bonus!
- Yeah, there we go.

1022
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:41,660
Put the next target out there.

1023
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:55,460
Just hold it.

1024
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:59,900
What the hell's going on here?

1025
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:05,740
Just cleaning your gun, like you asked.

1026
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:08,420
You're cleaning my gun, huh?

1027
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:14,220
- Dad...
- Hey!

1028
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:27,270
Look at him now, boys.

1029
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:31,890
Ain't nothing like a little fear
to make a paper man crumble.

1030
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:43,680
Here for the refills, Eddie?

1031
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:44,710
Yeah.

1032
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,520
You know
it's all bullshit, right?

1033
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:55,690
What is?

1034
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:57,470
Your medication.

1035
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:59,340
They're placebos.

1036
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:00,550
What's placebo mean?

1037
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:02,220
Placebo means bullshit.

1038
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:06,450
No friends, huh?

1039
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,430
Your cast.

1040
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,500
No signatures or anything?

1041
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:11,990
So sad.

1042
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:14,860
I didn't want it to get dirty.

1043
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,100
I'll sign it for you.

1044
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:35,860
You okay, Henry?

1045
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:48,780
And this is my most
favorite part of the afternoon.

1046
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:51,860
Getting to know all about
so many of you.

1047
01:33:52,110 --> 01:33:54,030
Is there someone here
that wants to share with us

1048
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:56,160
- what they most enjoyed about today?
- Me!

1049
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,250
How about you?

1050
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:58,750
I liked seeing the clown.

1051
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:00,580
You did?
You liked the clown?

1052
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:01,780
Yes!

1053
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:03,540
What about the rest of you?

1054
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:05,190
I liked when the bubbles float.

1055
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,140
You did? Me too.

1056
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,580
I just love watching things float.

1057
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:10,790
We all float.

1058
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:12,170
That's right.

1059
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:14,460
And you will, too, Henry.

1060
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:16,500
Make it a wonderful day.

1061
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:18,020
Kill him.

1062
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:21,100
Kill him. Kill him.

1063
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,380
Kill him. Kill him.

1064
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,460
Kill him. Kill him.

1065
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:30,700
Oh, no.
Give a big round of applause!

1066
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,260
Well done, Henry.

1067
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:42,660
Kill them all. Kill them all.

1068
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:45,980
Kill them all!

1069
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:48,940
Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!

1070
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:53,500
Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!

1071
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:17,810
Where are you
sneaking off to?

1072
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,460
Nowhere, Daddy.

1073
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:29,260
You're looking prettied up.

1074
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:32,710
I'm not prettied up, Daddy.
I wear this almost every day.

1075
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,060
Come.

1076
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:53,380
You know I worry about you, Bevvie.

1077
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,130
I know.

1078
01:35:55,670 --> 01:36:00,460
People in town have been
saying some things to me about you.

1079
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:04,540
Sneaking around all summer long
with a bunch of boys.

1080
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:06,900
The only girl in the pack.

1081
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:09,540
They're just friends, I swear.

1082
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:15,580
I know what's in boys' minds
when they look at you, Bevvie.

1083
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:17,860
I know all too well.

1084
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,860
My hand...

1085
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:25,500
Are you doing womanly things
down in the woods with those boys?

1086
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:29,300
No, no, no, nothing.
You don't have to worry. I promise.

1087
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:30,950
What's this?

1088
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:34,540
It's nothing. It's just a poem.

1089
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,340
Just a poem?

1090
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,890
But you had to hide it
in your underwear drawer.

1091
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:43,500
Why would you have to hide it there?

1092
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,180
Are you still my girl?

1093
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:48,630
No.

1094
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:49,950
What did you say?

1095
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:52,340
I said, no!

1096
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:56,490
No!

1097
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:59,780
Get away, no!

1098
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:03,060
Get off!

1099
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:04,570
No!

1100
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:10,930
Those boys.
Do they know that you're my...

1101
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:37,820
Beverly?

1102
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:04,380
Beverly!

1103
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:15,340
- Richie.
- What do you want?

1104
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:18,220
See that guy I'm hitting?
I'm pretending it's you.

1105
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:20,650
It got Beverly.

1106
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:22,300
What are you talking about?

1107
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:25,140
It, Richie.

1108
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:27,540
It got Beverly.

1109
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:43,460
Hello?

1110
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:47,610
Okay.

1111
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:50,700
I'll meet you there.

1112
01:39:57,390 --> 01:39:59,030
And just where do you think
you're off to?

1113
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:00,340
Out with my friends.

1114
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:03,530
Sweetie, you can't go.

1115
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:05,510
You're getting over
your sickness, remember?

1116
01:40:06,230 --> 01:40:07,660
My sickness?

1117
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:09,780
Okay, what sickness, Ma?

1118
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:14,620
You know what these are?
They're gazebos!

1119
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:15,970
They're bullshit!

1120
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:24,300
They help you, Eddie.

1121
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,900
I had to protect you.

1122
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:28,460
Protect me?

1123
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:31,620
By lying to me? By keeping me locked
inside this hellhole?

1124
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:33,360
I'm sorry but the only people that were

1125
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:35,620
actually trying to protect me
were my friends.

1126
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,240
And you made me turn my back on them
when I really needed them.

1127
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:39,270
So I'm going.

1128
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:42,220
Eddie. Eddie. No.

1129
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:43,460
You get back here.

1130
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:45,680
- Sorry, Mom, I gotta go save my friends.
- Eddie!

1131
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,300
Don't do this to me, Eddie!

1132
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,130
Guys, spikes.

1133
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:04,630
Stan?

1134
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:08,980
Stan, we all have to go.

1135
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:11,300
Beverly was right.

1136
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:16,020
If we split up like last time,
that clown will kill us one by one.

1137
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:19,860
But if we stick together,

1138
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:22,660
all of us,

1139
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:25,900
we'll win.

1140
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:27,770
I promise.

1141
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:57,140
Hey, Eddie, you got a quarter?

1142
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:00,860
I wouldn't want to make a wish
in that fucking thing.

1143
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:07,540
Beverly?

1144
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:09,470
How are we supposed to
get down there?

1145
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:12,540
All right. Come on.

1146
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:30,820
All right.

1147
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:13,100
Guys, guys. Help.

1148
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:17,110
- All right, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1149
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:24,260
Step right up,
Beverly. Step right up.

1150
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:29,450
Come change. Come float.
You'll laugh. You'll cry.

1151
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:33,100
You'll cheer. You'll die.

1152
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:37,860
Introducing Pennywise the Dancing Clown.

1153
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:14,780
I'm not afraid of you.

1154
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:23,220
You will be.

1155
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:38,500
Help! Help me!

1156
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,570
Ahhh!

1157
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,070
Die!

1158
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:55,260
Mike!

1159
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:56,940
- Mike!
- Mike!

1160
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:59,300
You okay? Mike!

1161
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:00,830
Bowers.

1162
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:02,420
Mike. Fuck.

1163
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:05,340
- Mike!
- Where is he?

1164
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:07,850
We're next.

1165
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:09,660
No, no, no!

1166
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:11,710
- Grab it!
- Get the rope! Get the rope!

1167
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:12,790
Oh, shit.

1168
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,620
- Mike!
- Mike!

1169
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:18,020
Leave him alone!

1170
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:21,820
You didn't listen to what I told you,
did you?

1171
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:25,820
You should've stayed out of Derry.

1172
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:28,860
Your parents didn't
and look what happened to them.

1173
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:32,550
I still get sad every time
I pass by that pile of ashes.

1174
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:34,220
Sad,

1175
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:36,710
that I couldn't have done it myself.

1176
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:39,260
Run, Mike!

1177
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:46,930
Mike!

1178
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:49,250
Fuck down!

1179
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:54,340
I should get up there.

1180
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:56,660
Are you insane? With what?

1181
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:26,580
Holy shit.

1182
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,460
- Oh, my...
- Mike!

1183
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:32,500
I'm okay.

1184
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:34,260
I'm okay.

1185
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:39,410
Shoot!

1186
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:42,540
Stanley.

1187
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:44,780
Beverly?

1188
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:49,220
Is that you?

1189
01:48:57,790 --> 01:48:58,820
Guys?

1190
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:03,540
Guys?

1191
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:09,980
- What?
- Guys, where's Stan?

1192
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:11,190
Stanley!

1193
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:12,610
Stanley!

1194
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:13,820
Stan!

1195
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:17,020
Oh, shit. Greywater.

1196
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:21,030
Stan?

1197
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:23,100
Stan?

1198
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,390
Stanley!

1199
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:51,900
- Stan!
- Shit! Stan!

1200
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:54,020
Stanley!

1201
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,750
- We're coming, man!
- We're coming! Don't worry.

1202
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:02,170
- Stan?
- Stanley! Stan!

1203
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:03,390
His flashlight!

1204
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,020
What the fuck is that thing?

1205
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:10,350
Oh, shit.

1206
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:17,710
Oh, shit.

1207
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:26,270
Oh, shit!

1208
01:50:27,110 --> 01:50:28,110
Oh, shit!

1209
01:50:29,150 --> 01:50:30,180
Stanley!

1210
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:32,180
- Stanley! Stan!
- Stanley!

1211
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:35,500
No! No! No!

1212
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:36,840
It's okay.

1213
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:39,780
You left me!
You took me into Neibolt!

1214
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:41,020
You're not my friends!

1215
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:43,060
You made me go into Neibolt!

1216
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:44,350
Stanley, I'm sorry.

1217
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:45,980
You made me go into Neibolt!

1218
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:49,580
This is your fault.

1219
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:54,400
We would never let anything happen
to you.

1220
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:55,490
We're here for you.

1221
01:50:55,710 --> 01:50:58,940
You know we wouldn't do that to you.
Come on.

1222
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:01,220
Bill! Bill!

1223
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:03,190
Bill!

1224
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:04,570
Bill!

1225
01:51:36,630 --> 01:51:37,820
Beverly!

1226
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:05,940
I'll come back for you, Bev.

1227
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:14,890
Bill!

1228
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:19,090
Bill!

1229
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:23,020
Bill!

1230
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:24,750
Come on.

1231
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:26,400
Get out of there, dude.
That's greywater.

1232
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:28,580
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, my fucking flashlight?

1233
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:30,420
Eddie!

1234
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:37,230
Come on, let's get the fuck
out of here! Come on!

1235
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:56,340
- Holy shit.
- Bev? Bev?

1236
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,860
- Beverly?
- Holy shit.

1237
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:00,790
Bev.

1238
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:08,700
How is she in the air?

1239
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:12,220
Guys.

1240
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:14,620
Are those...

1241
01:53:15,630 --> 01:53:16,900
The missing kids.

1242
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:19,050
Floating.

1243
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:22,580
- Just let me grab her.
- Shit.

1244
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:29,500
I'm slipping.

1245
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:38,910
Bev.

1246
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:41,580
Beverly.

1247
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:43,420
Why isn't she waking up?

1248
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:45,340
What is wrong with her?

1249
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:47,660
Beverly, please! Come on!

1250
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:01,980
Wow.

1251
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:07,850
Bev?

1252
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:13,940
"January embers"

1253
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:16,660
"My heart burns there too"

1254
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:20,620
Jesus, fuck.

1255
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:23,500
Oh, God.

1256
01:54:32,670 --> 01:54:34,020
Where's Bill?

1257
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:39,900
Georgie.

1258
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:44,900
What took you so long?

1259
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:52,020
I was looking for you this whole time.

1260
01:54:53,670 --> 01:54:56,420
I couldn't find my way outta here.

1261
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:01,740
He said I could have
my boat back, Billy.

1262
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:08,620
Was she fast?

1263
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,700
I couldn't keep up with it.

1264
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:15,170
"She," Georgie.

1265
01:55:18,190 --> 01:55:19,820
You call boats "she."

1266
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:24,540
Take me home, Billy.

1267
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:33,380
I wanna go home.

1268
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:40,730
I miss you.
I wanna be with Mom and Dad.

1269
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:46,220
I want more than anything
for you to be home.

1270
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:51,540
With Mom and Dad.

1271
01:55:53,630 --> 01:55:56,060
I miss you so much.

1272
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:02,620
I love you, Billy.

1273
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:05,660
I love you, too.

1274
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:16,140
But you're not Georgie.

1275
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:03,310
Kill It, Bill! Kill It!

1276
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:04,460
Shit.

1277
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:06,340
Kill It, Bill!

1278
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:08,910
Kill It! Bill, Kill It!

1279
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:10,480
Kill It!

1280
01:57:10,510 --> 01:57:11,510
- Kill It!
- Kill!

1281
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:12,670
Kill It!

1282
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:14,230
It's not loaded.

1283
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:16,660
Do it now, Bill!
Kill It! Kill It!

1284
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:19,500
Hey! It's not loaded!

1285
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:24,020
Holy fuck.

1286
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:26,380
Oh, shit.

1287
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:34,950
Bill, watch out!

1288
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:39,630
Leave him alone!

1289
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:42,670
Beverly, no!

1290
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:43,890
Mike!

1291
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:50,310
Help him!

1292
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:52,180
Fuck!

1293
01:57:53,870 --> 01:57:54,930
Ben!

1294
01:57:59,590 --> 01:58:01,420
Stanley!

1295
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:09,380
Bill!

1296
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:11,910
Bill!

1297
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:13,780
No, don't.

1298
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:15,550
Let him go.

1299
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:16,860
No.

1300
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:18,900
I'll take him.

1301
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:21,060
I'll take all of you.

1302
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:26,060
And I'll feast on your flesh
as I feed on your fear.

1303
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:31,220
Or,

1304
01:58:33,070 --> 01:58:35,220
you'll just leave us be.

1305
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:38,460
I will take him, only him

1306
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:41,220
and then I will have my long rest

1307
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:45,540
and you will all live to grow
and thrive

1308
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:49,260
and lead happy lives

1309
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:53,610
until old age takes you back
to the weeds.

1310
01:58:57,470 --> 01:58:58,660
Leave...

1311
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:03,060
I'm the one who dragged you all into this.

1312
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:05,940
I'm so sorry.

1313
01:59:06,150 --> 01:59:07,320
Sorry.

1314
01:59:11,630 --> 01:59:13,740
Go!

1315
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:16,980
Guys, we can't!

1316
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:20,580
I'm sorry.

1317
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:24,500
I told you, Bill.

1318
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:26,260
I fucking told you.

1319
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:29,260
I don't want to die.

1320
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:31,260
It's your fault.

1321
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:35,620
You punched me in the face.

1322
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:37,310
You made me walk through shitty water.

1323
01:59:37,550 --> 01:59:39,270
You brought me to a fucking
crackhead house.

1324
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:41,940
And now...

1325
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:47,340
I'm gonna have to kill
this fucking clown.

1326
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:49,780
Welcome to the Losers' Club, asshole!

1327
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:58,940
- Mike!
- Mike!

1328
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,860
Stan, watch out!

1329
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:09,690
Mike!

1330
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:20,190
Kill him!

1331
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:50,540
I'm gonna kill you!

1332
02:00:56,070 --> 02:00:58,900
Hey, Bevvie.
Are you still my little...

1333
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:09,670
Oh, shit!

1334
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:31,540
That's why you didn't kill Beverly.

1335
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:36,060
'Cause she wasn't afraid.

1336
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:38,550
And we aren't either.

1337
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:40,780
Not anymore.

1338
02:01:43,230 --> 02:01:45,300
Now you're the one who's afraid.

1339
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:48,580
Because you're gonna starve.

1340
02:01:55,710 --> 02:01:58,270
"He thrusts
his fists against the posts

1341
02:01:58,430 --> 02:02:01,900
"and still insists he sees the ghosts

1342
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:05,180
"He thrusts
his fists against the posts"

1343
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:25,780
Fear...

1344
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:40,540
I know what I'm doing
for my summer experience essay.

1345
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:55,420
Guys. Guys.

1346
02:02:56,990 --> 02:02:59,140
The kids are floating down.

1347
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:20,300
I can only remember parts,

1348
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:23,140
I thought I was dead.

1349
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:26,300
That's what it felt like.

1350
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:30,740
I saw us, all of us together
back in the cistern,

1351
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:32,820
but we were older,

1352
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:35,540
like, our parents' ages.

1353
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:39,900
What were we all doing there?

1354
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:42,500
I just remember how we felt.

1355
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:45,780
How scared we were.

1356
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:48,340
I don't think I can ever forget that.

1357
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:54,750
Swear it.

1358
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:57,100
Swear

1359
02:04:57,630 --> 02:04:59,620
if It isn't dead,

1360
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:03,740
if It ever comes back,
we'll come back, too.

1361
02:06:28,630 --> 02:06:29,660
I gotta go.

1362
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:33,510
I hate you.

1363
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:45,620
I'll see you later.

1364
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:46,950
Bye, Stan.

1365
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:53,620
Bye, guys.

1366
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:54,830
Bye, Mike.

1367
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:56,150
See you later, losers.

1368
02:06:58,030 --> 02:06:59,160
See you around, Bill.

1369
02:06:59,190 --> 02:07:00,220
See you, Rich.

1370
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:01,450
See you guys later.

1371
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:04,620
Bye, Ben.

1372
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:12,060
You all packed for Portland?

1373
02:07:13,070 --> 02:07:15,220
Yeah, pretty much.

1374
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:16,890
I'm going tomorrow morning.

1375
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:18,900
How long will you be gone?

1376
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:24,740
My aunt, she says I can stay
for as long as I want, so...

1377
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:29,260
Just so you know...

1378
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:33,500
I never felt like a loser
when I was with all of you.

1379
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:45,380
See you around.

1380
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:34,130
Bye.
